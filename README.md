# Sign Up Form

I've made this project during my JavaScript Full-Stack curriculum from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form">The Odin Project</a>

What was new ?

- Form basics and validation with and without JavaScript
- Working with tables
- Using Emmet in an efficient way

- Styling, units, selectors and positioning
- Introduction to Frameworks and Preprocessors
